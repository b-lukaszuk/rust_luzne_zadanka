# Book 2

Selected bits/exercises from "Get Programming with Go" by Youngman N. and Peppe R.

For training I will solve them with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), despite the fact that the code examples from the book are written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

The snippets/programs written at a whim, sometimes modified, and used for educational purposes.

# Lesson 06. Real Numbers

## Task 1

Write a piggy bank program. It randomly adds nickles ($0.05), dimes ($0.10) and quarters ($0.25) until the balance of >= $20.00 is reached.

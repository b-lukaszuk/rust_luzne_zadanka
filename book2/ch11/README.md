# Book 2

Selected bits/exercises from "Get Programming with Go" by Youngman N. and Peppe R.

For training I will solve them with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), despite the fact that the code examples from the book are written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

The snippets/programs written at a whim, sometimes modified, and used for educational purposes.

# Lesson 11. The Vigenère Cipher

## Task 1

Write a program that ciphers a message using classic [Vigenère Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

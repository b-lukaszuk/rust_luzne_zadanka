# Book 2

Selected bits/exercises from "Get Programming with Go" by Youngman N. and Peppe R.

For training I will solve them with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), despite the fact that the code examples from the book are written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

The snippets/programs written at a whim, sometimes modified, and used for educational purposes.

# Lesson 05. Ticket to Mars

## Task 1

Write a program that compares prices of tickets to Mars issued by different spaceliners. Generate 10 random tickets and display them in tabular format like:

```
Spaceline           Days    Trip type       Price
=================================================
Virgin Galactic     23      Round-trip      $ 96
Virgin Galactic     39      One-way         $ 37
```

Spacelines to choose from: {Space Adventures, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic}
Let's say Mars is 62,100,000 km away from Earth.
Speed: [16 - 30] km/s.
Price range [36 - 50] usd.
Faster ships are more expensive.
Round trips cost double.

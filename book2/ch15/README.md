# Book 2

Selected bits/exercises from "Get Programming with Go" by Youngman N. and Peppe R.

For training I will solve them with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), despite the fact that the code examples from the book are written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

The snippets/programs written at a whim, sometimes modified, and used for educational purposes.

# Lesson 15. Capstone: Temperature Tables

## Task 1

Write a program that displays temeprature conversion tables (range -40:100 by 5) for Celsius -> Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit -> Celsius.

Use a function `drawTable` that takes other function as parameter and calls it to get data for each row drawn.

# Book 2

Selected bits/exercises from "Get Programming with Go" by Youngman N. and Peppe R.

For training I will solve them with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), despite the fact that the code examples from the book are written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

The snippets/programs written at a whim, sometimes modified, and used for educational purposes.

# Lesson 18. A Bigger Slice

## Task 1

Write a loop to append elements (one at a time) to a slice. Print out the capacity whenever it changes.
